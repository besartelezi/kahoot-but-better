# If Kahoot is that good, why isn't there a Kahoot 2?
Introducing, Kahoot 2!
I will be creating my very own Kahoot-esque quiz.
Our coaches gave us a quiz database called the [open trivia database](https://opentdb.com/).
And with all the information they gave us, I created the following carefully crafted formula:
````
(API + React*(creativity)) / Intensification Of Kahoot Music = Successful Quiz App
````

So in general, the goal of this assignment is to learn how to work with React, and practice my API-knowledge again.
But my personal goal is to fully complete this assignment and add a custom made quiz of my own on a json file.
In the past I have had some problems fetching data from a json, so I'd like to use this assignment as a learning opportunity for that specifically.

## React: Really Extravagant And Cruel Technology
I personally have not worked with React yet, but I did work with Angular in a prior assignment.
So I'm a little familiar with frameworks and libraries.
But all frameworks/libraries are different, with their own advantages and disadvantages.
So for starters, I will try to learn a bit more about how React works, learn a bit about Hooks, Functional Components, Components in general, and more!

### What's up with React?!
The very short and very sweet sentence given to me by the React documentation describes React as follows: "A javascript library for building user interfaces".
It's also very important to state that React is 'Declarative' and 'Component-Based'.

Design simple views **for each state**  in your application. <br>
React will efficiently update and render *juuuuust* the right components with your data changes. <br>
This will all help you to create interactive UIs.
